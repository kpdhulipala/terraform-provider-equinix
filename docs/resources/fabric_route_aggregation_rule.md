## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "equinix_fabric_route_aggregation_rule" "ra_rule" {
  route_aggregation_id = "<route_aggregation_id>"
  name = "ra-rule-test"
  description = "Route aggregation rule"
  prefix = "192.168.0.0/24"
}

output "route_aggregation_rule_name" {
  value = equinix_fabric_route_aggregation_rule.ra_rule.name
}

output "route_aggregation_rule_description" {
  value = equinix_fabric_route_aggregation_rule.ra_rule.description
}

output "route_aggregation_rule_type" {
  value = equinix_fabric_route_aggregation_rule.ra_rule.type
}

output "route_aggregation_rule_prefix" {
  value = equinix_fabric_route_aggregation_rule.ra_rule.prefix
}

output "route_aggregation_rule_state" {

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Customer provided name of the route aggregation rule
- `prefix` (String) Customer-provided route aggregation rule prefix
- `route_aggregation_id` (String) UUID of the Route Aggregation to apply this Rule to

### Optional

- `description` (String) Customer-provided route aggregation rule description
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `change` (Attributes) Current state of latest route aggregation rule change (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--change))
- `change_log` (Attributes) Details of the last change on the stream resource (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--change_log))
- `href` (String) Equinix auto generated URI to the route aggregation rule resource
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the resource
- `state` (String) Value representing provisioning status for the route aggregation rule resource
- `type` (String) Equinix defined Route Aggregation Type; BGP_IPv4_PREFIX_AGGREGATION, BGP_IPv6_PREFIX_AGGREGATION
- `uuid` (String) Equinix-assigned unique id for the route aggregation rule resource

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
